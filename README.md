This is a multi-user authentication system, it's my first steps on django and it's part of a bigger project, where the goal is to make a complete booking site for an internship forum.


To run the project:
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NinotN10/multi-user-django-authentication.git
```
2. Run migration
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
3. Create super user
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
4. Run the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
